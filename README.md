## Description

Dummy login, single page banking application. Sample login details provided next to the login button. Focus in this app is mainly on manipulating simple dataset and displaying changes on to the page.

### DESIGN

HTML and CSS Flexbox single page app, JavaScript functional programming, and Document Object Model (DOM).

### LOGIC

JavaScript code is split into 4 files, data.js holds two account dummy data, helperFunctions.js formats transaction dates and currency, updatingUI.js runs all the functions required to display UI, script.js defines event listeners and performs data manipulation.

Dummy login performed by checking user credentials and if correct, sets CSS opacity value from 0 to 100. Bank functionality allows users to transfer funds, request loans, and close current account. All of the actions are temporary and after page refresh reverts to the original dataset.
